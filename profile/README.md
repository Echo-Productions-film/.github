## What are we currently working on?
Starfall  
*An ancient war reignites. A forgotten world holds the key.*  
Starfall is a Star Wars fan series set long after the events of the latest movies.  
The story takes you away from the usual Star Wars galaxy to a little-known planet named Earth.  
Starfall is a sci-fi fantasy series where a group of campers discover a crashed alien ship,  
unlocking ancient secrets, powerful technology, and a destiny that ties them to a galactic conflict.
